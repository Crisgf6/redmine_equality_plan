# Redmine Plan de Igualdad

_Este README est치 disponible en espa침ol [en Espa침ol](README.md)_

With this plugin for Redmine, we want to put the first stone to promote
equality in the companies that use this project management software.

And not only gender equality can be visualized with this plugin, you can also
use to make visible inequalities of ethnicity, language, religion or color.


## What it offers
 * Visualization of the total number of men and women in the organization
 * Statistical indicators by groups within the company.
 * Indicators by gender of training, leave or type of contract.
 * ... and more to come. Do you have something on your mind? Let's talk!
